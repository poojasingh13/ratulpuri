			<h3>Strong Mandate will give us a Powerful nation</h3>
			</div>
			<p class="lead">
				This election witnessed Mr Narendra Modi repeat a Rajiv Gandhi’s 1984 feat  by acquiring a clear majority. Mr. Ratul Puri Chairman of Hindustan Powerprojects Private Ltd predicts an implementation of the highly praised Gujarat model. With no tantrum display from alliance parties Mr Modi is expected to go all guns blazing on implementing a blueprint seen in development of China.<br/><br/>
				The new government could follow China’s trend of primary focus on Infrastructure, manufacturing and service bagging the second and third places in the list. So Mr. Puri feels India will witness a positive surge by implementing this model.<br/><br/>
				Also Infrastructure will attract manufacturing that will pull a huge workforce and with construction will be massive boon specially for the unorganized workforce, also attracting skilled workforce jobs.<br/><br/>
				So I am hopeful that "achhe din ane wale hain" will not just be a poster hotshot.
