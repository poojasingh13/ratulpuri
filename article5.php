			<h1>High hopes from Modi and Team</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="lead">
				<p>India Inc. hails decisive mandate for Modi-led BJP given by its voters. Higher hopes are leading to greater responsibility for the new government. The corporate sector is looking for bold reforms, boost economic growth and create jobs to initiate a “golden era of change”.

Industrialist, Ratul Puri, of Hindutan Powerprojects believes, “creating multiple new cities with amenities, its vision for energy to generate more, use rationally and waste less augurs well for the Indian power sector.” 

Alongside, he was also hopeful that BJP-led government would bring more infrastructure development, modernization and liberalization. This government is also expected to immediately deal with issues pertaining to inflation, fiscal deficit and unemployment specifically. People’s expectations from a stable government are very high and the BJP-led NDA will have to deliver the same effectively and efficiently.
