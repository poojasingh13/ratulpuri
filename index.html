				<b>Indians keen on electricity, not so much on gold</b><br/>
			Akshaya Tritiya witnessed a sharp decline in Gold sales this year. The festival which serves as a traditional excuse by the hugely gold fanatic Indian population to stack up gold was hugely affected by economic uncertainty this time, see report. There was a steep fall of almost 15% in demand for gold with smaller jewellers and a notable is a 95% decline in trading of gold exchange- traded funds. In numbers, while on the same date previous year investors made their wallets Rs 1,306 crores lighter, this year it stood at a mere Rs 71.27 crores. The equation seems to be disturbed right from importing of the yellow metal. The imports have fallen 7 times from last year considering the same time period of April-May in between 2013 and 2014. So, it turns out the bullish fall of the sensex was not foolish, it certainly has affected the economy and the market.
On the same note, people have been rushing to ensure that they do not face brunt of the summer, imported coal getting costlier & sale of invertors has seen a spike over last few days.
As India awaits a new Government in the next few days, what blockbuster it creates at the Bombay Sensex at Dalal Street needs to be seen.
Will coal prove to be the new gold? <a href="http://www.hindustanpowerprojects.com/indians-keen-electricity-much-gold-2/" rel="nofollow">Read More..</a>

<b>Panel discussion on Challenges in the Indian power sector</b><br/>
			Here are excerpts from a panel discussion that I attended today. I was joined by Dr R S Sharma, MD, Jindal Power and Dr Arvind Prasad, Director, FICCI on the panel.
Pitching strongly for implementing coal price pooling in the country to meet increasing coal demand in the country, I was contesting that there is no immediate solution to the problem being faced by power producers.
“Moreover, there is no alternate, but to augment domestic coal production in the long term” I said while discussing problems in the power sector.

<b>Agenda before the new government: Serious challenges that we should overcome.</b><br/>
			Not getting timely approvals or frequent change in the policies and guidelines are proving to be one of the big hurdles in front of the India power sector. In fact there are multitudes of approvals needed, sometimes from the same department more than once, for the same project . This results in huge losses and crucial management bandwidth being wasted. If the entire approval process could be streamlined into a time bound clearance mechanism, it would aid the industry significantly.
Other challenges which the energy sector is facing is acute shortage of raw material which is coal or gas, high interest rates, challenges associated with land acquisition, health of SEBs which should be taken due care off. Changes in sovereign laws of countries, like Indonesia which has pushed up import prices of coal is also another challenge the sector is facing.
There is a strong buzz that the government is planning to revoke the fuel supply assurances given to coal-based power projects that have failed to meet their commercial production deadline. However, there are various reasons which are beyond the control of the developers. This issue must be looked upon by the government before taking a final call.

<b>Challenges Before Indian Energy Sector</b><br/>
			Having experienced near double digit growth over the last decade, India now faces the challenging task of meeting the aspirations of young India. I believe, that the expectations – employment, better life – can only be met with solving the energy deficiency in the country.
Thanks to numerous policy reforms over the past 20 years, the Indian energy sector has seen a shift towards addressing the needs of the consumer. However, the Indian energy sector today is facing a major dichotomy – one hand you have able and willing consumers who are ready to pay for the electricity and on other hand you a well equipped power generators willing to fulfil the demand. The inability of discoms to connect the consumers with the buyers has resulted in many thermal power plants lying idle. Adding to this, the long developmental cycle for conventional energy (7-10 years) and many other challenges has meant there will be only very limited incremental conventional power projects getting commissioned post 2017. All the while the energy requirement of Country will grow in significant proportion.

<b>Hindustan Cleanenergy signs 30 MW and 20 MW PPAs for solar projects in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh respectively</b><br/>
			With an installed capacity of ~ 350 MW generating carbon savings of approx 500000 tonnes per year, Hindustan Cleanenergy is the largest solar farm developer in the country
The clean energy arm of Hindustan Powerprojects has been awarded three prestigious projects for developing solar farms in the states of Punjab and U.P. Hindustan Cleanenergy Limited, the largest developer of renewable energy in the country has executed its power purchase agreement (PPA) for two solar projects of 15MW each with the Punjab government and the third one 20MW solar project with the Uttar Pradesh government. The projects were won by the company through a competitive bid and are expected to go on stream during the current year itself. The company’s strong track record in commissioning solar farms with high level of energy generation indicates sound commercial viability of solar projects in the country. These projects will help both Punjab and Uttar Pradesh with their initiatives to accelerate the pace of overall development in the states there by making way for focus on renewable sector.
