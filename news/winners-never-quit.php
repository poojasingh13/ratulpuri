			<h1>Winners never quit</h1>
			
			<p>
				Ratul Puri is a man in a hurry. Within six years of entering the power generation business, he has

emerged as the man behind the largest solar power generator in the country. The entrepreneur has 

earned the grudging respect of his peers and competitors, many of whom expected him to fail in his 

latest venture.</p>
<p>In his latest endeavour, the 42-year-old Delhi-based HPPPL chairman is working at breakneck speed 
to cash in on the early-mover advantage in the renewable energy sector: He is among the first to set 
up solar plants across India, in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rajasthan and West Bengal, among other states.
</p>
<p>Since the launch of his company in 2008, Puri has commissioned 400MW-worth of solar power 

projects (250MW for India and the rest for overseas). The aim is to generate 5,000MW of energy by 

2017.</p>
<p>HPPPL’s first thermal project will be operational later this year. He is also building hydropower assets 

and has taken the first steps in wind power. That’s not all: Puri wants to develop another 6,100MW 

of power generation capacity using conventional (thermal) and non-conventional (solar, wind, 

hydro) energy sources in the long term.</p>
<p>The company’s solar business alone generated EBIDTA, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 

and amortisation, of Rs 500 crore in FY2014 on revenues of Rs 900 crore. When the first phase of the 

thermal asset becomes operational later this year, he expects HPPPL’s EBIDTA to increase to nearly 

Rs 3,500 crore by FY2016.</p>
<p>Puri is investing Rs 35,000 crore towards all these projects by 2017: By the end of FY2014, HPPPL 

would have put in Rs 20,000 crore, and will raise the remaining Rs 15,000 crore over the next 

three years. If the company meets its deadlines, it will probably be the first private or government 

undertaking in India to generate more than 1GW of solar energy.</p>
<p>“By opting for solar power for short term, thermal for mid-term and hydro power for long term, the

company has aligned itself with India’s power generation strategy,” says Puri, who has set a brutal 

pace for himself and HPPPL.</p>
