				<p>Hindustan Powerprojects with a vision of commissioning 7000 MW of power by 2020 in thermal, solar and hydro is a leading player in the energy sector from India. The Company is in advanced stage of commissioning over 5000 MW by 2017 of combined power assets at an estimated investment of INR 32,000 crores ( USD 5.15 bn). In addition to the above, the company is also developing over 6100 MW of capacity using conventional and non-conventional energy sources in India, Europe and the USA. India is the fourth largest consumer of energy in the world after USA, China and Russia but it is not replete with abundant energy resources. It must, therefore, meet its development needs by using all available resources. This understanding helped the Company to focus on renewable energy in short-mid-term, and conventional energy for mid-long term. Secured supply chains, diversified customer base and focus on right technology for the geography is ensuring a risk mitigated growth.</p>
				<p>Hindustan Power has consistently been focusing on giving maximum returns to its stakeholders through corporate growth and social responsibility. The company is head quartered in New Delhi and has power generation assets in the states of Chhatisgarh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh in India and in countries like Germany, Italy, US, UK and Japan.</p>
