				<p>Energy sector has been the recently sworn in Prime Minister’s keen interest for the development of a state. As the new government headed by Narender Modi takes charge, the energy sector is looking for a revamp of policies pertaining to energy and natural resources’ firms. It is believed that these firms are looking for policies that allow sustainable and environment friendly manner to utilize India’s energy and natural resources optimally, hence to reduce the annual import bill for natural resources. 
Among the many industrial spokesperson, Ratul Puri, Chairman, Hindustan Powerprojects feels that there is a strong commitment on part of the BJP to resolve all obstacles affecting the growth of the power sector and creating multiple new cities with amenities, its vision for energy to generate more, use rationally and waste less augurs well for the Indian power sector. 
Ratul Puri thinks it is likely that their proposed National Energy policy will be a road map on key aspects and help maximize the potential of all resources-oil, gas, hydro, solar, coal amongst others. By altering the use and opting for domestic coal and oil might help reduce the import bill. He also feels that it is advisable to avoid overdependence on one supplier, diversify the suppliers or better develop indigenous capacities to meet needs.
Overall it is expected that the new government will have clear reforms and forward looking policies on top of its agenda that can open up this sector's potential to contribute and strongly impact the GDP growth of the country.
