				<p>Latest addition to Hindustan Powerproject’s portfolio is a thermal power plant in Annupur, Madhya Pradesh. The plant still in its first phase was accorded certificate of Hydro test of the unit 2 Boiler by the concerned authority. The plant with a capacity of 12oo MW has been scheduled for commissioning during the current year.
 
 Ratul Puri, Chairman, Hindustan Power Projects has all positive things to say about this upcoming plant for his company. He said, “The phenomenal progress on this state-of-art power project in a record time truly reflects the technology used and aspirations of the locals to achieve economic development.”

Before being completely operational, it is one of the critical landmarks that it’s fully checked and equipped as per the Indian Boiler Regulation guidelines. The process is towards commissioning of a thermal power plant as it is the test of pressurizing the boiler to 1.5 times its design pressure so that the pressure parts (portion of Boiler in which the water & steam flows in the Boiler) is erected, welded and radio graphically tested. It successfully complies with the guidelines.
