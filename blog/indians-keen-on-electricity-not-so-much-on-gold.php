			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshaya_Tritiya" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Akshaya Tritiya</a> witnessed a sharp decline in Gold sales this year. The festival which serves as a traditional excuse by the hugely gold 
			fanatic Indian population to stack up gold was hugely affected by economic uncertainty this time, see 
			<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/investment-world/real-assets/gold-lacks-lustre-in-akshaya-tritiya-week/article5975826.ece">report</a>.

			In numbers, while on the same date previous year investors made their wallets Rs 1,306 crores lighter, this year it stood at a mere Rs 71.27 crores. </p><p>
			The equation seems to be disturbed right from importing of the yellow metal. The imports have fallen 7 times from last year considering 
			the same time period of April-May in between 2013 and 2014. So, it turns out the bullish fall of the sensex was not foolish, it certainly has 
			affected the economy and the market.<br/><br/>

			Will coal prove to be the new gold?</p><p>
