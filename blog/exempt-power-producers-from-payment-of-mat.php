			<h1>Exempt power producers from payment of MAT</h1>
			<p>
				The current Government has to enact a fine balancing act in order to manage the Revenue gap, deal with Subsidies valued around Rs. 2,46,000 crore, Revive the GDP growth and more significantly Providing uninterrupted 24*7 power supply to the country.
			</p>
			<p>
			The fiscal deficit of about Rs 2,408.37 billion ($40.05 billion), or 45.6% of the full-year target, almost 5% GDP along with subsidies are the critical aspects that hinder the private investment, which are very essential for the revival of the economy. Hence the Government needs to address these in the upcoming budget. <br/>
In order to create and sustain a robust growth, India needs to address the shortfall in its infrastructure facilities and clear the log jammed projects. 

			</p>
			<p>
			In a report released in October 2013, Asian Development Bank had identified a funding gap of more than $100 billion. In a bid to lift economic growth to above 8%, the government should implement the 5yr target of investing $1 trillion in infrastructure by 2017, with half coming from the private sector. By doing this, the government shall be to able provide the necessary thrust to manufacturing industry and hence create employment. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Investments in the infrastructure sector - a key priority and an enabler for manufacturing - have slowed down over last 3 years. The Government needs to provide short term fiscal incentives to kick start economy: 
			<ol>
			<li>Adjusted taxable income (ATI) extend the benefits under section 80 IA & IB to companies for a longer term - A long term visibility of ATI will help in better planning and optimum utilization of resources. Currently, this is extended for one year periods only thereby not allowing the companies to do long term planning by including ATI in their scheme of implementation. </li>
			<li>Exempt power producers from payment of Minimum Alternate tax (MAT) - This should result in an enhanced free cash for companies in the short term and enable better deployment of funds. This will also improve the commercial viability of the projects. </li>
			<li>Introduce long term (20-30 years) finance for the infrastructure projects - Currently commercial banks offer debt for a 10-12 year period post the COD /PPA whereas the project funding is required for 20-30 years. Match in the concession period from commercial banks and Infrastructure Development Fund would go a long way in improving the commercial viability and reducing the distress of the sector.</li>
			<li>Renewables, especially solar, is a key solution to meet India's energy needs (big focus of the current government) - The Renewable needs to be included in the priority lending sector with increased renewable limit.  Carving out of renewable separately from the conventional power sector will provide renewed thrust on the sector. This should help the country in setting and achieving aggressive goal of 100 GW in 10 years from solar sector. </li>
			</ol>
